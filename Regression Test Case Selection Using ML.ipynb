    "Regression testing is the common task of retesting software that has been changed or extended by new features during software development and most of the time retesting the whole program is not feasible with reasonable time and cost, and to overcome only a subset of all test cases is executed for regression testing, e.g., by executing test cases according to test case prioritization.\n",

    "There are a vast amount of methods for test case selection exist but mostly it is a based on domain expertise of Test Engineers/Subject Matter Expert.As obvious, this manual process is time consuming, iterative and largely depends upon the engineer's skills which mean there are high chances of missing some relevant test cases."
